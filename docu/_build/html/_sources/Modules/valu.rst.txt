Vector Arithmetic and Logic Unit
================================

The Vector Arithmetic and Logic Unit (VALU) handles arithmetic instructions. It consists of four 32-bit adder/subtractor IPs. This allows the VALU
to operate on multiple elements per clock cycle depending on the ``VSEW`` (selected element width) configuration.
