# This test code is to demonstrate UART functionality of the
# Pipelined RV32IMC + Protocol controllers
#
# An external device sends a lowercase character to the FPGA, and outputs
# the uppercase character.
# ==========================
# Register usage:
#		gp -> points to PROTOCOLMEM addresses
#		s0 -> x0 for compressed instructions
#		s1 -> TXBF
#		s2 -> Asserted if valid data has been received
#		s11 -> WRDONE & RDDONE status from previous interrupt
#		t0-t6 -> local subroutine registers (not saved between calls)
#		a0-a1 -> subroutine return values
#		a2-a7 -> subroutine arguments
# ==========================
# NOTE: when passing arguments to subroutines, store them in a2-a7
# If return values are needed, store them in a0-a1
